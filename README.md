# Hangman-Game

This is the Hangman Game for HW3. To start playing a new game or start a new round after winning/losing, press the spacebar.

Once the game has started, you will see the word or words shown as dashes. You can guess letters by typing them out on the keyboard. Correct letters will appear in the game playing field. All guesses will appear in the letters guessed field.

If you reach a game end condition (guessing the word correctly or running out of guesses) the round is over. A win or loss will be recorded.

Each game starts with 12 wrong guesses. If you produce the correct answer the image on the page will chage to match the character.
